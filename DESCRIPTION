Description: A graphics device for R that is accessible via network protocols.
    This package was created to make it easier to embed live R graphics in 
    integrated development environments and other applications.
    The included 'HTML/JavaScript' client (plot viewer) aims to provide a better overall user experience when dealing with R graphics.
    The device asynchronously serves graphics via 'HTTP' and 'WebSockets'.
